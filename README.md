## 🛠️ Foxhole Colonial Logistics Calculator

### **A Web-Based Tool for Efficient Resource Planning**

This project is a web application designed to help Colonial logistics players in the game **Foxhole** quickly calculate the total resource cost (Salvage, Components, etc.) and production time required to manufacture specific items and shipments.

-----

## ✨ Features & Goals

This project is currently in the **early development phase**.

### 🎯 Core Goal

To provide an instant breakdown of raw resource costs for any given quantity of a Colonial item.

### 🚧 Current Status & Future Features

| Status | Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **In Progress** | **Core HTML/CSS Structure** | Establishing the layout and styling for the calculator interface. |
| **To Do** | **Calculation Logic** | Implementing the JavaScript/PHP logic to perform accurate resource cost calculations. |
| **To Do** | **Item Database** | Creating an accurate, up-to-date JSON or data structure of all Colonial item costs. |
| **To Do** | **Live Production Time** | Adding a feature to estimate the total production time based on factory/assembly methods. |

## 💻 Technologies Used

This project is a great learning opportunity for full-stack web development.

  * **Frontend:** **HTML5** and **CSS3** (currently the main focus).
  * **Logic:** **JavaScript** (for front-end user interaction and validation).
  * **Backend/Data:** **PHP** and **Hack** (as seen in current files, planned for handling complex data and calculations or potentially serving as a small API).

## 🚀 Getting Started

We encourage you to set up a **live demo** for your calculator as soon as possible. Once you do, be sure to update this section\!

### Live Demo

[Link to your live calculator (e.g., GitHub Pages link) here\!]

### Local Setup for Development

If you want to contribute, follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Cihaimasuiro/Foxhole-Colonial-Logistics-Log.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Foxhole-Colonial-Logistics-Log
    ```
3.  **Run Locally:**
      * For the current files (`Tugas6`): Since the project uses PHP, you will need a local web server environment (like XAMPP or MAMP) to run the PHP files correctly.
      * Alternatively, for simple HTML/CSS/JS testing, you can open the main `.html` file directly in your browser.
